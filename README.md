# CustomCore

CustomCore is a database-driven custom gaming PC store and PC-building website.
Customers can browse configurable prebuilt systems, use a guided custom builder
with compatibility feedback, manage accounts and saved builds, and complete a
simulated checkout. Administrators manage catalogue data, orders, reviews,
consultations, themes, reports, and site monitoring.

This repository is a university web-development project intended for deployment
on standard shared PHP/MySQL hosting (for example `myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca`).

## Technology stack

- HTML5
- External CSS (including three switchable site themes)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- PHP with sessions
- MySQL via PDO prepared statements
- Git / GitHub

No React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Laravel, Docker, Composer, or URL rewriting is
required. The application uses ordinary `.php` URLs for hosting compatibility.

## Current status

**Commit 2.7 complete** — secure admin creation script added.

`database/create-admin.php` is a CLI-only interactive script that creates an
admin user with a bcrypt-hashed password. No plain-text passwords are stored
in Git. The script validates the email, enforces minimum password length,
confirms the password, and handles duplicate accounts gracefully.

Next: **Commit 2.8** — database import guide and documentation updates.

## Security notes

- Never commit real database credentials.
- The live config file `config/database.php` is ignored by Git.
- Use [`config/database.example.php`](config/database.example.php) as the template
  (see [`config/README.md`](config/README.md)).
- Never commit plain-text passwords or private customer data.
