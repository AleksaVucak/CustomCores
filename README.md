# CustomCore

CustomCore is a database-driven custom gaming PC store and PC-building website.
Customers can browse configurable prebuilt systems, use a guided custom builder
with compatibility feedback, manage accounts and saved builds, and complete a
simulated checkout. Administrators manage catalogue data, orders, reviews,
consultations, themes, reports, and site monitoring.

This repository is a university web-development project intended for deployment
on standard shared PHP/MySQL hosting (for example `myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca`).

## Technology stack

- HTML5
- External CSS (including three switchable site themes)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- PHP with sessions
- MySQL via PDO prepared statements
- Git / GitHub

No React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Laravel, Docker, Composer, or URL rewriting is
required. The application uses ordinary `.php` URLs for hosting compatibility.

## Current status

**Commit 7.2 complete** — product review submission.

Logged-in customers can submit a rating (1–5), title, and review body from
`product.php` or `reviews.php`. Every new review is inserted with
`status = pending` so it stays out of public listings until an administrator
approves it (Stage 9). CSRF protection, server + client validation, and a
one-review-per-product rule (pending/approved) are enforced. Shared helpers
live in `includes/reviews.php`.

**Commit 7.1 complete** — customer wishlists.

Next: **Commit 7.3** — PC consultation request form.

## Security notes

- Never commit real database credentials.
- The live config file `config/database.php` is ignored by Git.
- Use [`config/database.example.php`](config/database.example.php) as the template
  (see [`config/README.md`](config/README.md)).
- Never commit plain-text passwords or private customer data.
