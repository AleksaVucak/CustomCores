# CustomCore

CustomCore is a database-driven custom gaming PC store and PC-building website.
Customers can browse configurable prebuilt systems, use a guided custom builder
with compatibility feedback, manage accounts and saved builds, and complete a
simulated checkout. Administrators manage catalogue data, orders, reviews,
consultations, themes, reports, and site monitoring.

This repository is a university web-development project intended for deployment
on standard shared PHP/MySQL hosting (for example `myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca`).

## Technology stack

- HTML5
- External CSS (including three switchable site themes)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- PHP with sessions
- MySQL via PDO prepared statements
- Git / GitHub

No React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Laravel, Docker, Composer, or URL rewriting is
required. The application uses ordinary `.php` URLs for hosting compatibility.

## Current status

**Commit 6.3 complete** — persist carts for customer accounts.

The cart is fully database-backed (`carts` + `cart_items` tables) so it survives
logout and login. On login, the cart count is pre-loaded into the session. The nav
shows a live badge with the item count. Every cart mutation refreshes the cached
count so the badge stays accurate across all pages.

Next: **Commit 6.4** — validated checkout form.

## Security notes

- Never commit real database credentials.
- The live config file `config/database.php` is ignored by Git.
- Use [`config/database.example.php`](config/database.example.php) as the template
  (see [`config/README.md`](config/README.md)).
- Never commit plain-text passwords or private customer data.
