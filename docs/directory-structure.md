# CustomCore — Application Directory Structure

**Document type:** Stage 1 foundation (Commit 1.1)  
**Purpose:** Record the repository folder layout so later commits place files in the correct locations.  
**Rule:** Do not add empty feature pages only to inflate page counts. Routes from `docs/sitemap.md` are implemented when their stage arrives.

## 1. Top-level layout

```text
customcore/
├── admin/                 # Administrator PHP pages (Stage 9+)
├── api/                   # Lightweight JSON/data endpoints (Stage 5+)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/               # Base, admin, and print stylesheets
│   ├── themes/            # Three switchable site themes (Stage 10)
│   ├── js/                # External JavaScript
│   ├── images/            # Copyright-safe images (Stage 8)
│   └── media/             # Video/audio learning items (Stage 8)
├── config/                # App and database configuration (Commit 1.2+)
├── database/              # schema.sql, seeds, admin setup (Stage 2)
├── docs/                  # Planning and project documentation
├── help/                  # Static Help wiki HTML (Stage 11)
├── includes/              # Shared PHP layout and helpers (Commit 1.4+)
├── uploads/
│   ├── consultation/      # Safe consultation attachments
│   └── products/          # Admin product image uploads
├── index.php              # Application entry / homepage (expanded Stage 3)
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── .gitignore
```

Root feature pages (`about.php`, `catalogue.php`, `builder.php`, …) are added in their feature stages, not as empty stubs in Commit 1.1.

## 4. Alignment checks

- [x] Folders match the architecture described in the project roadmap and `docs/sitemap.md`
- [x] Upload directories exist and are ready for ignored user content
- [x] Asset, config, database, includes, admin, api, and help locations exist
- [x] No fake catalogue/admin feature pages were added solely for page count
